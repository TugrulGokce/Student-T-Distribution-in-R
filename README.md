# Student-T-Distribution-in-R


# Purpose of the study

My purpose in doing this study is to show that as the size of the samples taken from a population increases, the higher the df (degree of freedom), the closer to the normal distribution.

*I found a dataset from Kaggle that indicates the height, weight and gender of people.

I took 50 samples of size 16 from this data set.
And then I calculated the mean, standard deviation of this sample, and based on these I calculated the t-value.

Likewise, I chose 50 samples of 6 sizes.I also calculated the t-value for this

Then, using these t-values, I graphed how Student's t-distribution changes for df.

# Result 
As df increases, it approaches the normal distribution. As df increases, we get a pointed gaussian curve.
